Thanks for attending my session at [ODSC East
2022](https://odsc.com/speakers/manipulating-and-visualizing-data-with-r-2/).

## Setup

For this course you need a recent version of R. Anything greater than
4.0 is good but 4.1 is even better. I also highly recommend using your
IDE/code editor of choice. Most people use either
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [R Language
Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r).

After you have R and your favorite editor installed, you should install
the packages needed today with the following line of code.

``` r
install.packages(c('dplyr', 'ggplot2', 'ggthemes', 'ggridges', 'readr'))
```

## Code

Throughout the class I will be pushing code to this repo in case you
need to catch up. Most, if not all, will be in the `code` folder.
